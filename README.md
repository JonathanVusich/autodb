# autoDB
This is a NoSQL database written in pure Python designed to be fast and functional.

# Why autoDB?
In production environments, SQL is the unquestioned database of choice. It's fast, efficient, and endlessly customizable.
But often for smaller projects where speed is less important than portability and ease of use, SQL-based databases can be 
overkill. This is where autoDB comes in. It is designed to automatically handle arbitrary Python classes with ease, indexing them and allowing the user to
perform basic queries on them. It also is written to be completely cross-platform, and is designed to need as little baby-sitting as possible.
